// The Fortune Teller
//
// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
//
// Write a function named tellFortune that:
//
//     takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
//     returns a string that looks like this: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
//     Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments; each time you call the function, capture the return value of the function (the string) in a new variable, and on a new line, print out the contents of the variable
//

// const numberOfChildren = 2
// const partnersName = "Ailsa"
// const geographicLocation = "Yamba"
// const jobTitle = "Retired"

// const fortune = `You will be a ${jobTitle} in ${geographicLocation}, and married to ${partnersName} with ${number}`;

// console.log(fortune);

const fortuneTold = function (numberOfChildren, partnersName, geographicLocation, jobTitle) {
    const output = `You will be a ${jobTitle} in ${geographicLocation}, and married to ${partnersName} with ${numberOfChildren} children`;
    return output;
}

fortuneTold (7, "JJ", "N-NSW", "King");

// The Puppy Age Calculator
//
// You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!
//
// Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
//
//     takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
//     calculates your dog's human-equivalent age based on the conversion rate of 7 human years to 1 dog year.
//     returns a string that looks like this: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
//     Call the function three times with different sets of values.
//     Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the puppy's age; each time you call the function, capture the return value of the function (the string) in a new variable, and on a new line, print out the contents of the variable
//     Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.
//
let puppyToHumanAgeGlobal;

const calculateDogAge = function (puppysAge) {
    const puppyToHumanAge = puppysAge * 7;
    const conversionRate = puppyToHumanAge / puppysAge;
    console.log(`Your doggie is ${puppyToHumanAge} years old in dog years. And the conversion rate is ${conversionRate} dog years to human years`)
    return puppyToHumanAgeGlobal = puppyToHumanAge;
};

// The Lifetime Supply Calculator
//
// Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
//
// Write a function named calculateSupply that:
//
//     takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
//     calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a fixed maximum age).
//     returns a string that looks like this: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
//     Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments; each time you call the function, capture the return value of the function (the string) in a new variable, and on a new line, print out the contents of the variable
//     Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
//

let lifetimeSupplyGlobal;
const calculateSupply = function(age, amountPerDay){
    const maxAge = 85; 
    const lifetimeSupply = (maxAge - age) * 365.25 * amountPerDay;
    console.log(`You will need ${lifetimeSupply.toFixed(0)} to last you until the ripe old age of ${maxAge}`)
    return lifetimeSupplyGlobal = lifetimeSupply;
}

// The Temperature Converter
//
// It's hot out! Let's make a converter.
//
// Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit which:
//
//     Takes a celsius temperature as its argument.
//
//     Converts it to fahrenheit and returns this value from the function
//
//     Call the funtion this way:
//         Create a variable called celsius and store a temperature value in it
//         Call the celsiusToFahrenheit function and pass the celsius variable as the argument.
//         Capture the return value of the function into a new variable, and use both this variable and your original celsius input variable to print out a result like "XX°C is YY°F".
//
//     Now do the reverse calculation by creating a function called fahrenheitToCelsius. Pass a variable called fahrenheit into this function when you call it.
//
// BONUS: prompt the user for the temperatures to convert, instead of hardcoding them into variables.

let celsius;
let fahrenheit;
const celsiusToFahrenheit = function (celsius, ){
    // Some function to converts C to F and returns the value 
    let fahrenheit = (celsius * (9/5)) + 32;
    console.log(`${celsius} degrees celsius is ${fahrenheit} degrees fahrenheit`);
